# Nexus Github Pages Starter Kit

Nexus is a peer-to-peer Micro Social Network.  
This is the Nexus GitHub Pages Starter Kit repository. 

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub.  
They are available to free accounts!  

## Getting started

If do not have a GitHub account, start by creating one: [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup), and then come back here.

Click the `Fork` button to create a copy of this Starter Kit on your account.

Upload your media files in `media/` if any.

If you're unfamiliar with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), you can add new files through the GitHub website:

- in your Nexus repository, navigate to the folder where you want to place files
- click the `Add file` button
- select your file(s)
- click `Commit changes`.

You can also use the GitHub desktop application: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).

Click `â‡£` to download your new .json file.
