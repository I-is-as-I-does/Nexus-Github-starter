# Nexus Github Pages Starter Kit

Nexus is a peer-to-peer Micro Social Network.  
This is the Nexus GitHub Pages Starter Kit repository. 

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub.  
They are available to free accounts!

Upload your media files in `nexus/media/` if any.

Click `⇣` to download your new .json file.
