# Nexus Github Pages Starter Kit

Nexus is a peer-to-peer Micro Social Network.  
This is the Nexus GitHub Pages Starter Kit repository. 

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub.  
They are available to free accounts!  

## Getting started

If do not have a GitHub account, start by creating one: [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

Click the `Fork` button to create a copy of this Starter Kit on your account.  
Go to the `Settings` tab.  
- in `Options`: **rename** `Nexus-Github-starter` to **`nexus`**  
- in `Pages`: select `main` as **branch** and `root` as **folder**, then click `Save`.

***
Optional: edit `index.html` to change app attributes as desired:  

- if you wish to set a custom theme, add `data-style="path/to/your/theme.css"` to the `div` tag
- if you prefer to use another app than [Nexus-IO](https://github.com/I-is-as-I-does/Nexus-IO), change `script src` 
- if you would like to specify a default language, add `data-lang="place-lang-code-here"` to the `div` tag

Commit your changes.
***

Upload your media files in `media/` if any.  

***
If you're unfamiliar with [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), you can add new files through the GitHub website:

- in your Nexus repository, navigate to the folder where you want to place files
- click the `Add file` button
- select your file(s)
- click `Commit changes`.

You can also use the GitHub desktop application: [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
***

Launch the Editor: `https://your-github-handle.github.io/nexus/?edit` and fill in the form.  
Click the 'down arrow' icon to download your new .json file.  
In your repository, replace `source/nexus.json` with your updated Nexus .json file.  

Access your Nexus: `https://your-github-handle.github.io/nexus/`.
